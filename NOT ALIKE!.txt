C lang, C Drive
carebare, Bearshare
They bed, iPod


That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic, when we're on it
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's not alike us on the mic (yeah!)


A verse





You say you're affiliated with typescript, stuxnet
The code you runin is thuggin' (gang)
But you're just a wanna be gunner (gang)
Like you was gonna run something
Acting like you catching bodies (ayy)
And you got juice, lil' youngin', you're bugging
You ain't never even been charged with connection to battery
Bitch, you ain't used in nothing

real code spit compile like bullets (boom)
And gats cock, your partners better tool up
This has not to do with typing
But have guns for sure, you better put a
Strap on, in other words if you're sync
Roll up with your (gang)
You're gon' need new modules
'Cause this bar is over your head
So you better have arms if you're gonna pull up (skrt)
Oh, you run the web, huh?
Now you wanna come and fuck with me, huh?

This little trial language, he must be feeling himself
He wants to keep up
His tough demeanor, so he does a feature
Decides to team up with v8
But next time you don't gotta use new Tech 
If you wanna come at me with async code

And I'm talking to you but you already know who the fuck you R, ECMA
I don't use asnc and sure as fuck don't bug up
But keep commenting on my compiler JDK
I keep on telling motherfuckers, bitches, in case you forgot
Really I need jaw memories, jaw like strawberry or pineapple, apricot jelly

I respond, rarely but this time Java
'Bout to sound off like a fucking cocked semi Glock
Demigod, let me put a silencer on this little non-threatening ripoff
web code taking shots at me
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rocksteady Crew
Obviously, I'm not getting through
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach, letting off like Remy Ma
Heavy artillery, gotta deal a harsh with a hard shell
Put a motherfucking heart in bigger than Bizarre's belly
Only time you'll ever say, I lost

You'll be talking 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Just to try to get me off and you better hope I don't call Oracle
Bitch, this shit don't fly in domain
Punk, you don't disrespect OG's, R.I.P. Prodigy
