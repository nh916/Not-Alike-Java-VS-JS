# Not-Alike-Java-VS-JS


JAVA VS JAVASCRIPT NOT ALIKE!

Eminem released a song called we are not alike where he told MGK that they are not alike and how he is inferior. I wanted to make a rap song for JAVA telling JAVASCRIPT that they are different and how Javascript is inferior. 

Java and Javascript are mixed up often because they sound similar and I got it mixed up when I first started too. I was thinking we can make a fun rap song based on Not Alike by Eminem where Java disses Javascript, its fun way to help anyone starting tell them apart.

I started on the Not Alike rap lyrics but so far my rap isnt great, and I thought if we all pitch in we can make an awesome rap and anyone who starts out in JS and Java will know that they are different, know their differences, and learn more about programming on the way.
